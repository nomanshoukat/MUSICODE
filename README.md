- **Ontology for MUSICODE**


- **Description**

MUSICODE is an experimentally-validated multi-scale material, process, and device modeling & design platform enabling non-expert access to open innovation in the organic and large area electronics industry. It is a European collaborative research and innovation project led by a multi-disciplinary consortium coordinated by University Ioannina. To read more about the project, visit http://musicode.eu/

- **MUSICODE Ontology**

The "Musicode Ontology" provides the ontological description of MUSICODE and OLAE in general. The ontology development process has been initiated by identifying the discrete applications in the project. Then, the bottom-up approach was used to model all the identified applications. The identified applications are simulation, fabrication, characterization, manufactured devices, and materials. The finalized MUSICODE ontology is a union of all five application ontologies. 
The ontology has been built using web ontology language (OWL) and protégé software. The concepts and classes used in the other ontologies, i.e., EMMO, and BattINFO, have been reused and extended whenever needed. All the partners were involved in the development process by providing feedback and required information to construct an ontology. The required information was collected by using pre-defined data collection templates.

- **How to exploit the ontology?**

The MUSICODE_Ontology.ttl file can be viewed in any ontology editor offline, e.g., Protégé, online by using the WEBVOWL tool. 
Ontologies_for_MUSICODE.pdf contains more information about ontology development process and some specified ontology views.
