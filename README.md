#SRO
The ontology which showcases all the simulation activities in the MUSICODE platform is called simulation requirement ontology (SRO). 
The SRO represents the division of all simulation processes according to length scale and the responsible partner/ organization. It also shows the connection between the different partners and the importance of outputs of one simulation activity for another. The concepts, data items, naming conventions, and relations have been finalized after a rigorous discussion with partners. The partners who have been actively involved in the discussion were UOI, Tinnit, USUR, and KIT.
